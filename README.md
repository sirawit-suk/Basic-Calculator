## Brief Explaination
### AJAX Brief
- It's like when you only want to update only section of the page (not the whole page). AJAX will come in handy.
- It's not a language, it's like a technic how to reduce bandwidth load when update something often.
### AJAX Usecase
- Facebook news feed, when scroll down and news feed keep updating only 1 section, not the whole long enormous page (if it does, consume more banwidth, this consider as bad practice).
- Google search engine, searchbar when typing something and keep suggest.
